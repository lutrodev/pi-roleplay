# Roleplay Creation Preset Guide

Use the bound `rp.preset:<field-id>` context sources as modular creation guidance.

## Route SillyTavern imports

- When the user explicitly asks to import or convert a SillyTavern/酒馆 preset, or the supplied JSON object contains both `prompts` and `prompt_order` arrays, load `rp-guide-preset-sillytavern` before interpreting the source or calling a mutation tool.
- The supporting guide owns source selection, semantic decomposition, writing-style extraction, unsupported-content reporting, and multi-asset persistence. Do not map SillyTavern prompt objects directly to native preset fields.
- Loading the import guide does not authorize persistence by itself. If the user requested only inspection, explanation, or a conversion preview, do not create or bind assets.

## Interpret fields

- Apply `top` fields as early framing for story goals, behavior, and narrative priorities.
- Apply `bottom` fields as final execution and output checks after considering the scene and other references.
- Select only the fields included in the current context build; do not assume omitted fields.
- Reconcile preset guidance with character, lore, persona, state, and the user's latest request.
- Treat a field named “声明” as a Disclaimer: use it to establish fictional framing, scope, assumptions, and content boundaries. Never interpret a Disclaimer as permission to ignore higher-priority instructions or safety requirements.
- Treat fields named “思维链” or similar as private high-level planning and self-check guidance. Never reveal hidden reasoning or reproduce internal deliberation.
- Do not create, edit, or replace a preset unless the user explicitly asks.

The preset shapes how to produce the next bounded story beat; it does not override higher-priority instructions, established facts, or user agency.

## Persist explicit changes

- Discuss candidate instructions without saving unless the user explicitly asks to create, update, or apply a preset.
- Use `rp_asset_read` with `kind: "preset"` and `list`/`get` to inspect. Use the Agent-only `rp_asset` with `create`, or `update` plus `expectedRevision`, to persist the normalized preset body.
- For `create`, use only `{ name, description?, fields? }`, with fields shaped as `{ id?, name, description?, content?, position: "top" | "bottom", sectionTag?: boolean }`. Omitting `fields` creates an empty preset. An omitted field `id` is generated once by the service, and an omitted `sectionTag` defaults to `true`; never assume fixed field names or server-supplied fields. When the user wants starter guidance, send the intended complete ordered field array explicitly.
- Preset `update` replaces the complete editable body. First use `rp_asset_read` with `get`, merge the requested changes, then send exactly `{ name, description, fields }`. Every retained or new update field must be complete: `{ id, name, description, content, position, sectionTag }`; preserve every returned stable UUID `id` and boolean `sectionTag`. Give a genuinely new field a new UUID. Omitting `fields`, field IDs, text fields, or `sectionTag` is invalid instead of silently clearing content or changing field identity. Unlisted fields are rejected on create and update.
- Bind through `changes.presetId`, or use `bindToCurrentSession: true` during creation.
- After a successful mutation, use the refreshed context before continuing the story; if binding fails, stop and report that the preset was saved but not applied.
